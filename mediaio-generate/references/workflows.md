# Workflow Generation

Use only workflows exposed by the currently installed BIN. Workflow identifiers and schemas are dynamic; historical names in planning documents are not executable unless they appear in live discovery.

## Discover

```bash
mediaio workflow list
mediaio workflow get <workflow_name>
```

Take the exact identifier from the first column of `workflow list`. `workflow get` prints the accepted parameters, defaults, allowed values, media fields, and raw credit configuration. These commands produce their documented human-readable output and have no optional JSON mode.

## Prepare media

Generation parameters accept uploaded file IDs, not local paths. Upload every local input first:

```bash
mediaio upload create ./source.mp4
mediaio upload create ./reference.png
```

Save each returned `file_id`, then map it to the exact parameter name shown by `workflow get`.

## Submit

Workflows use the same create command as models, and `--yes` is required on every submission:

```bash
mediaio generate create <workflow_name> [--param value]... --yes
```

The create response prints a `task_id=<id>` line. Wait separately:

```bash
mediaio generate wait <task_id> --timeout 20m --interval 3s
```

Retrieve the result file with the CLI instead of copying its signed URL:

```bash
mediaio generate download <task_id> --output-dir "$tmp_dir"
```

To query a known task directly when both values are available:

```bash
mediaio generate query <workflow_name> <task_id>
```

## Cost information

`generate create` says nothing about cost by default. Add `--show-credit` when the user is cost-sensitive or has asked about credits, and report the number it prints with the result. Run `mediaio generate estimate <workflow_name> [--param value]...` instead when they want a say before spending: it submits nothing, and returns the credit cost, whether this request is free, and the account balance.

The cost is computed server-side for the signed-in account, so `estimate: 0 credit(s)` / `free: yes` is authoritative — this request costs nothing. There is no "free quota" or partial-free state: it is either free or charged. `free: no - this model is free for members` means a membership would make it free; report that as an option, do not switch models on your own.

`mediaio workflow get <workflow_name>` still prints the raw credit configuration for diagnostics.

## Historical inventory

`draw_to_video` and `reframe` were documented by the migrated reference set, but they are not current commands unless live `workflow list` returns those exact identifiers. Preserve their product requirements as planning input only:

- Draw-to-video: source video, edited frame, timestamp, and edit instruction.
- Reframe: source video, target aspect ratio, optional resolution, and optional reference media.

## Maintainer rule

For every documented workflow:

1. Confirm its exact identifier in live `mediaio workflow list`.
2. Confirm its complete schema with `mediaio workflow get <workflow_name>`.
3. Build examples only with `mediaio generate create --yes`, then `mediaio generate wait`.
4. Keep result lookup on `mediaio generate query <workflow_name> <task_id>` and result retrieval on `mediaio generate download <task_id>`.
5. Document cost only from `mediaio generate estimate` output returned by the live BIN.
