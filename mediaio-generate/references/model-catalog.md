## 0. How to use this file

1. **Static first.** Route ordinary intent from this file alone; do not run `mediaio model list`.
2. **After selecting, still run `mediaio model get <job_type>`** for the parameter schema. This file makes no promise about parameters and must not be used to infer them.
3. **Copy `job_type` byte for byte.** Never trim it, never change case, never "fix" a name that looks like a typo. Values containing a space must be quoted in the shell.
4. **Map display name to `job_type` only, never the reverse.** Display names and `job_type` disagree in many cases (see section 6) and some names are shared. When a name is ambiguous, list the candidates and let the user choose.
5. **Report your choice as `Display Name (job_type)`** so any mismatch is visible to the user.
6. **A live lookup is allowed only in these cases**; otherwise never run `model list`:
   - A model the user named is not in section 2 or 5 → `mediaio model list --grep <keyword> --output json`
   - Submission returned `unknown job type` → full `model list` to re-check, and warn that this catalog may be stale
   - The user explicitly asks to see all/latest models, or whether new models exist → full `model list`
   - You need to confirm a fallback target is still online before switching → `model list --grep`
   - This file's `generated_at` is more than 30 days old, or `catalog_schema_version` does not match what the skill expects (**decided locally, no request**)
   - This file is missing or its metadata block is corrupt → fall back to runtime discovery

## 1. Global defaults

| Scenario | Default model | job_type | Fallback | job_type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text to image (no reference image) | ToMoviee Lite | `text2image_soul_character` | ToMoviee Lite | `text2image_soul_character` |
| Image to image (with reference image) | ToMoviee 3.0 Pro | `image2image_media_3.0` | ToMoviee Lite | `image2image_media_1.0` |
| Video | Tomoviee 3.0 | `image2video_tomoviee_3.0` | Tomoviee 2.0 Fast | `image2video_tomoviee_2.0_fast` |

## 2. Featured models

| Display name | job_type | Access tier* | Inputs | When to pick it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ToMoviee Lite | `text2image_soul_character` | free | prompt | Default for pure text-to-image. text2image_media_3.0 does not exist in production; this is the free entry point that returns an image directly. Display name is ToMoviee Lite. |
| ToMoviee 3.0 Pro | `image2image_media_3.0` | vip_free | images, prompt | Default for image-to-image. First choice for character consistency, outfit control and character editing. Free for members; non-members are charged. |
| ToMoviee Pro (ex-Media 2.0) | `image2image_media_2.0` | vip_free | images, prompt | Member-free alternative to ToMoviee 3.0 Pro. Prefer it when a member wants another free option; non-members are charged. |
| ToMoviee Lite | `image2image_media_1.0` | free | images, prompt | Fallback target for image-to-image, and the free option in this module. Retry with this when permission or credits are insufficient. Display name is ToMoviee Lite. |
| GPT Image 2 | `text2image_gpt_image_2` | unknown | prompt | Use when text must be rendered accurately inside the image, or the composition is unusually complex. |
| GPT Image 2 | `image2image_gpt_image_2` | unknown | images, prompt | Use with a reference image when text must be rendered accurately. |
| Nano Banana Pro | `text2image_banana_2` | unknown | prompt | Anime, illustration and creative styles. Note the display name is Nano Banana Pro, not Nano Banana 2. |
| Nano Banana Pro | `image2image_banana_2` | unknown | images, prompt | Anime and creative styles with a reference image. Display name is Nano Banana Pro. |
| Tomoviee 3.0 | `image2video_tomoviee_3.0` | unknown | image, prompt | Default for video. Use it whenever there is no special requirement. |
| Tomoviee 2.0 Fast | `image2video_tomoviee_2.0_fast` | unknown | image, prompt | Fallback target for video. Use it when the user wants speed or lower cost, or when permission/credits are insufficient. |
| Seedance 2.5 | `image2video_seedance _2.5` | unknown | image, prompt | Long video, audio included, cinematic quality. The job_type contains one space; that is the real production value. |
| Seedance 2.5 | `image2video_seedance_2.5_reference_image` | unknown | images, prompt | Multi-reference video generation (up to 50 reference images); belongs to the reference2video module. |
| Kling 3.0 | `image2video_kling_3.0` | unknown | image, prompt | Strong physical simulation: shattering, fluids, collisions. |

\* Access tier is **manually curated**; the registry has no such field. `unknown` means it has not been confirmed with the product team. Whether a job actually costs credits is decided by `mediaio generate estimate` and the server response — never tell the user a model is free based on this file.

## 3. Scenario routing

Match in order and **stop at the first hit**; do not keep comparing.

### Text to image (no reference image)

| # | Condition | Pick | job_type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Text must be rendered accurately in the image, or the composition is unusually complex | GPT Image 2 | `text2image_gpt_image_2` |
| 2 | Anime, illustration or creative style | Nano Banana Pro | `text2image_banana_2` |
| 3 | Everything else | ToMoviee Lite | `text2image_soul_character` |

### Image to image (with reference image)

| # | Condition | Pick | job_type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Text must be rendered accurately in the image, or the composition is unusually complex | GPT Image 2 | `image2image_gpt_image_2` |
| 2 | Anime, illustration or creative style | Nano Banana Pro | `image2image_banana_2` |
| 3 | Everything else, including character consistency, outfit swap and character editing, AND `account status` reports a membership `level` of `standard` or `premium` | ToMoviee 3.0 Pro | `image2image_media_3.0` |
| 4 | Everything else, including character consistency, outfit swap and character editing, AND the account is not a member or the membership level is unknown | ToMoviee Lite | `image2image_media_1.0` |

### Video

| # | Condition | Pick | job_type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Multi-modal reference with several reference images | Seedance 2.5 | `image2video_seedance_2.5_reference_image` |
| 2 | Long video (around 30s), audio needed, or cinematic quality | Seedance 2.5 | `image2video_seedance _2.5` |
| 3 | Strong physical simulation: shattering, fluids, collisions | Kling 3.0 | `image2video_kling_3.0` |
| 4 | User explicitly asks for speed or lower cost | Tomoviee 2.0 Fast | `image2video_tomoviee_2.0_fast` |
| 5 | Everything else | Tomoviee 3.0 | `image2video_tomoviee_3.0` |

## 4. Fallback chain

Triggers: the server reports insufficient permission or insufficient credits, or the user explicitly asks for a free or cheaper option.

| Scenario | From | To | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text to image (no reference image) | `text2image_soul_character` | `text2image_soul_character` | The default already is the fallback; no switch needed |
| Image to image (with reference image) | `image2image_media_3.0` | `image2image_media_1.0` | Re-run estimate after switching, then submit |
| Video | `image2video_tomoviee_3.0` | `image2video_tomoviee_2.0_fast` | Re-run estimate after switching, then submit |

Before falling back, confirm the target is still online under the rules in section 0, then repeat the credit confirmation step.

## 6. Known pitfalls

### 6.1 job_type contains a space (6)

These are the real production values and **will not be changed**. Writing them without the space fails with `unknown job type`. Always quote them in the shell.

| job_type | Display name |
| --- | --- |
| `image2video_seedance _2.0_mini` | Seedance 2.0 Mini |
| `image2video_seedance _2.0_mini_head_and_tail` | Seedance 2.0 Mini |
| `image2video_seedance _2.5` | Seedance 2.5 |
| `image2video_seedance _2.5_head_and_tail` | Seedance 2.5 |
| `text2video_seedance _2.0_mini` | Seedance 2.0 Mini |
| `text2video_seedance _2.5` | Seedance 2.5 |

```bash
mediaio model get "image2video_seedance _2.0_mini"
```

### 6.2 Prefix does not match fun_module (12)

Never infer a model's module from its job_type prefix. Use this table.

| job_type | Actual fun_module |
| --- | --- |
| `image2video_gemini_omni_flash_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `image2video_happyhorse_1.0_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `image2video_happyhorse_1.5_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `image2video_kling_3.0_omni_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `image2video_kling_o1_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `image2video_minimax_h3_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `image2video_seedance2.0_fast_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `image2video_seedance_2.0_mini_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `image2video_seedance_2.5_reference_image` | reference2video |

| `image2video_wan_3.0_reference_image` | reference2video |
| `text2image_gemini_omni_flash` | text2video |

### 6.3 Duplicate display names (37 groups)

**A display name is not a primary key.** When the user names one of these, list the candidates and let them choose instead of silently taking the first.

### 6.4 Display name and job_type disagree

A historical artifact; `uni_fun_code` cannot be changed. **Map display name to job_type only, never the reverse.** Typical examples:

| job_type | Display name | Commonly misread as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image2image_banana_2` | Nano Banana Pro | Nano Banana 2 |
| `text2image_banana_2` | Nano Banana Pro | Nano Banana 2 |
| `text2image_soul_character` | ToMoviee Lite | a Soul / character-specific model |
| `image2video_tomoviee_2.5` | Seedance 2.0 | ToMoviee 2.5 |

### 6.5 ToMoviee is the first-party family, called 天幕 in Chinese

ToMoviee is our own model family. Its Chinese brand name is **天幕**. No display name is literally 天幕, so a user who asks for 天幕 will not match anything by search — resolve the request to the entries below, and let the user choose when several apply.

| job_type | Display name | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image2image_media_1.0` | ToMoviee Lite | image2image |
| `image2image_media_2.0` | ToMoviee Pro (ex-Media 2.0) | image2image |
| `image2image_media_3.0` | ToMoviee 3.0 Pro | image2image |
| `image2video_media_1.0` | ToMoviee 2.0 Pro (ex-Media 1.0) | image2video |
| `image2video_tomoviee_2.0` | ToMoviee 2.0 | image2video |
| `image2video_tomoviee_2.0_fast` | Tomoviee 2.0 Fast | image2video |
| `image2video_tomoviee_3.0` | Tomoviee 3.0 | image2video |
| `image2video_tomoviee_4.0` | Tomoviee-V4 Pro | image2video |
| `text2image_soul_character` | ToMoviee Lite | text2image |
| `text2image_tomoviee_2.0` | Tomoviee 2.0 | text2image |
| `text2video_tomoviee_2.0` | ToMoviee 2.0 | text2video |

## 7. Live-lookup command reference

```bash
# Find a model by keyword (only under condition 1 in section 0)
mediaio model list --grep seedance --output json

# Restrict to one module
mediaio model list --module image2video --output json

# Get the parameter schema (run this after every selection)
mediaio model get image2image_media_3.0

# job_type values containing a space must be quoted
mediaio model get "image2video_seedance _2.5"
```

> The default text output of `model list` has only `job_type / type / description` and **no display name**. Add `--output json` and read the `model` field when you need it.
